Or your eyes got used to green-on-black world so much that JIRA WebUI's bright background is just painful for you?\r\n\r\nTry jic - a command line client for JIRA, written in [Python|http://www.python.org], lightweight and easy to install.\r\n\r\nCurrently development is done privately, but it is expected to go public by 25 November 2013. Stay tuned. \r\n\r\nAuthors and Contributors\r\n------------------------\r\nThis project is developed under the [Linaro|http://www.linaro.org] umbrella - thanks to Linaro for helping engineers getting a more suitable interface to jIRA.\r\n\r\nThe project is lead by @ototo, who is also the only developer so far, but your complaints, ideas and patches are welcome!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
